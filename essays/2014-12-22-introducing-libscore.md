A few months ago I met a developer called <a href="http://julian.com">Julian Shapiro</a> who had just released <a href="http://julian.com/research/velocity/">Velocity.js</a>. After a bit of talking, he invited me to checkout this cool project he was working on called <a href="http://libscore.com">Libscore</a>.

> Every month, Libscore scans the the top million sites on the web to determine which third-party JavaScript libraries are installed on each site.

He invited me to help out and I ended up building out the public API and also running the crawlers on sponsored Digital Ocean servers.

Julian has wrote a much better post about Libscore titled <a href="https://medium.com/@Shapiro/introducing-libscore-com-be93165fa497">Introducing Libscore</a>.

If you have any great ideas for integrating with the <a href="https://github.com/julianshapiro/libscore">API</a>, please let me know!
